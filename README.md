## Dmochowski Lab - FUS-fMRI Project
The project combines low intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) stimulation with 
functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in order to understand the effects of tFUS on
human brain activity. 

## Data
The data is stored on the cloud via the Flywheel platform. The login page is [here](https://cuny-mri.flywheel.io/).

One of our tasks will be to use the Flywheel Python SDK to access the data. The SDK is available [here](https://flywheel-io.github.io/core/branches/master/python/index.html).

## Code
Our code will be stored in the [code](./code) subfolder.
